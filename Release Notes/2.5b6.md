GPGMail 2.5b6 - Release Notes
============================

Bugfixes
--------

*  Did we say auto-update? We did, but with b6 it should actually start to work as expected. GPGMail updates should be much smoother in the future.
*  When in your sent folder and select Email > Send again from the menubar, the resend mail did not respect your default setting to encrypt / sign mails. Now it does.
*  Minor typo in an error messages fixed.
