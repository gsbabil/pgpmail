GPGMail 2.5b5 - Release Notes
============================

Features
--------

### Displays a warning when the user tries to send an unencrypted reply to an encrypted message.

* Previously the message was sent unencrypted without prompting the user, which might have leaked confidential information.
* We now display an informative warning message.


Bugfixes
--------

*  10.10 only: Makes sure that GPGMail will allow to select a specific key from the "From:" menu when composing a new message, if more than one secret key is available for the same email address. #809
*  When a new message was created via Apple Script, Mail.app would crash under certain circumstances. Fixes this issue once and for all! #799 #804
*  GPGMail no longer clutters Console.app with "error CFBundle RegexKit.framework Data couldn't be read" messages. #796
*  Attachments of weird inline PGP encrypted messages from Windows are now properly displayed. #677
*  Mail no longer raises an exception if the font information is not available when generating the security header. #795
